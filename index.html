                    reaches at least 39°C.

                    feel in your chest.

                <p>
                  Some details about how the disease is spread are unknown and
                  is being determined.The WHO and CDC state that it is
                  primarily spread during close contact and by respiratory
                  droplets produced when people cough or sneeze; with close
                  contact being within 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet). A study in
                  Singapore found that an uncovered coughing can lead to
                  droplets travelling up to 4.5 metres (15 feet).

                  Respiratory droplets may also be produced during breathing
                  out, including when talking, though the virus is not
                  generally airborne. These droplets can land in the mouths or
                  noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into
                  the lungs. Some medical procedures such as intubation and

                <p>
                  The first symptoms of COVID-19 and influenza (flu)
                  infections are often very similar. They both cause fever and
                  similar respiratory symptoms, which can then range from mild
                  through to severe disease, and sometimes can be fatal.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Both viruses are also transmitted in the same way, by
                  coughing or sneezing, or by contact with hands, surfaces or
                  objects contaminated with the virus. As a result, the same
                  public health measures, such as hand hygiene (hand washing),
                  good respiratory etiquette (coughing into your elbow or into
                  a tissue and immediately disposing of the tissue) and good
                  household cleaning are important actions to prevent both
                  infections.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The speed of transmission is an important difference between
                  the two viruses. Influenza typically has a shorter
                  incubation period (the time from infection to appearance of
                  symptoms) than COVID-19. This means that influenza can
                  spread faster than COVID-19.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While the range of symptoms for the two viruses is similar,
                  the fraction with severe disease appears to be higher for
                  COVID-19. While most people have mild symptoms,
                  approximately 15% of people have severe infections and 5%
                  require intensive care in a hospital ICU. The proportions of
                  severe and critical COVID-19 infections are higher than for
                  influenza infections.

                  The speed of transmission is an important difference between
                  the two viruses. Influenza typically has a shorter
                  incubation period (the time from infection to appearance of

                  While the range of symptoms for the two viruses is similar,
                  the fraction with severe disease appears to be higher for
                  COVID-19. While most people have mild symptoms,
                  approximately 15% of people have severe infections and 5%
                  require intensive care in a hospital ICU. The proportions of
